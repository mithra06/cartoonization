# cartoonization

Here, I have used three types of cartoonifying an image

1. Cartoonify
2. Toonify
3. Filter effects

Inside cartoonify effect, we have used white box cartoonization. So, we will get an image like cartoon drawing 
And inside toonify effect, we will get some effects like Disney animated characters
In filter effects, we have 4 filters which is bilateral, pencil sketch,detail enhancement, pencil edges


Inside apps folder , we have these three types
We are using streamlit app, so we have to run apple.py
